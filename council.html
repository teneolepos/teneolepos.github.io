            <div class="column is-5" id="right">
                 <p>As a result of austerity, the UK has implemented massive budget cuts to their local councils. One way to lower costs is to digitize services by putting paper based information and forms online. This also improves the experience for residents by increasing access to crucial content as well as decreasing time to complete forms.</p>
                <p>I was brought on to help manage the production of content for the launch of a new website at a local council.</p>
                <p>I worked with a manager, two junior associates and two client copywriters. My role was to oversee the creation process and the delivery of the final content.</p>
                <p>I transitioned into the role of the sole UX designer for the entire implementation team after the first release. I was responsible for bringing concepts to life through prototypes, conducting user research, and providing direction on design decisions.</p>
                <p>This eventually evolved to me serving as product manager for design and frontend development.</p>
                <p>I worked with 2 senior frontend development managers and a junior developer, along with 2 senior developers from the client side.</p>
               <h3>Impact</h3>
               <ul>
                 <li>Delivered ~140 new pages of digital content from 13,000 pages for the initial release of a new age local council website</li>
                 <li>Defined and wrote the house style guide. Enforced the policy across stakeholders to ensure that all new content was aligned.</li>
                 <li>Delivered UX designs and frontend code for 2 releases</li>
                 <li>Designed and implemented 30 one-on-one user testing sessions as well as an online survey that reached around 3,000 local residents</li>
                 <li>Analyzed results and used statistics to help guide decisions on design</li>

               <h2>Tone and Style Guide</h2>
               <p>The client did not have a house style guide which means they did not speak to their residents in a consistent way. I wrote the house style guide based off best practices and further ensured that it was followed in each new piece of content we wrote. This was later on adopted by the marketing team for their print work as well.</p>

         <h2>Content Delivery</h2>
         <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was working with content owners who did not want their pages removed or did not want to write in the new tone of voice. As these issues were escalated to me, I set up one-on-one sessions with them and our copywriters who managed the relationship. We would discuss the purpose of the bigger website launch and then focus on understanding their requested changes or concerns. I found that most of the time, a lack of communication about the launch and other changes was the biggest cause of their struggles. Showing an appreciation of their area of expertise also opened up dialogue and allowed us to come to a compromise. As a result, we delivered on time, and helped create strong relationships for the copywriting/web team to maintain quality content for the future.</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>Forms are the main way residents interact with their council and receive services. We faced challenges where a) the forms were not digitized and b) the flow and content of the form itself often did not make sense and were no longer compliant with new regulations. To address these challenges, we first held workshops with staff that were most knowledgeable about the service to understand the purpose, content, and policies that underpinned the form. We then set out to re-organise and re-write the content.</p>
            <p>After the form had been revised and updated, we had to hand it over the development team to be built. The UX designer before me had used Axure to prototype the forms for the developers. This was to help show the backend developers the logic of the questions and to provide the frontend developers with the look and feel of the elements. As I took on the process, I realised that it had become tedious and somewhat inefficient. Because stakeholders often wanted to change the logic of the form, a lot of time was wasted fidgeting around with the interactions in the prototype. It was better to keep the prototype simple as a foundation for design and the question flow separate in a logical diagram or flow chart that could be easily followed. In addition, I found new tools to quickly create forms and visualize the logic tree for developers as a point of reference. Armed with a sample interactive form as well as the visual design elements, both frontend and backend teams had what they needed to continue forward.</p>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>We worked with the client to discuss which resident groups would be good candidates for user research. We identified the older than 50s and youth to be the first groups to invite to be part of the new Digital Engagement Group that we could consistently go back to for user research.</p>
            <p>I conducted a series of one-on-one interviews every other sprint. I tested already developed features and prototypes of proposed designs. Users were asked to speak aloud while I took notes and captured their interactions on the screen. Some tasks also involved A/B testing of the new and old versions.</p>
            <p>I then reported on the results by evaluating the frequency and severity of the issues. I determined a threshold based on these criteria that would determine whether a design change was to be implemented. I then fed this back to the product owner to be put into sprint.</P>
            <p>For content, we conducted tree testing to get feedback for the sitemap. There was a challenge in reaching residents without seeming intrusive. We finally identified a list of people that had previously participated in consultations that gave us a large enough sample size. Ultimately, we received around 45 responses and gained good insight on where big pain points were in the navigation journey.</p>

            <h2>Product Management</h2>
            <p>The team identified me as product manager because of my role as UX designer, strong relationships with the client and third parties, and programming knowledge. As the UX designer, I already created stories for the frontend development team.</p>
            <p>As a product manager, I managed the development team’s work load, led huddles and communicated with the business. This allowed the team to stay focused on finishing the site.</p>
            <p>I had strong relationships with the product owner and other BAs, and assisted other third party contractors. As a result, I developed a sense of trust with the rest of the teams in the greater project.</p>
            <p>My understanding of frontend programming allowed me to speak the same language as the developers. I further assisted in writing code if there were no design deadlines. This helped me be empathetic to the challenges the developers faced so that we could effectively work through them together and make great progress.</p>            <p>I conducted a series of one-on-one interviews every other sprint.
